<p style="text-align: justify; ">Many people buy their multimeters on eBay or similar sites, usually because they are much cheaper there. It is understandable that someone doesn&#39;t want to 
spend over 100 EUR/GBP for a multimeter when there are 20 EUR/GBP&nbsp;multimeters and even cheaper on eBay with, supposedly, the same features. Many years ago I bought one of these cheap eBay 
multimeters, too: a HoldPeak HP-6870; it has all the features one could hope for, including capacitance and inductance measurement. So why am I saying you shouldn&#39;t go for similar items?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">First off, here is a photo of the multimeter&nbsp;in question. As can be seen it&#39;s a manual range multimeter with tons of &#39;features&#39;, and according to 
the top cover, it&#39;s even rated &#39;CAT II&#39;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><img alt="cheap multimeter, front view" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5020142438_dcf608c128_z.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px; " /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Since I finally decided to recycle the multimeter, I opened it up to get a closer look at what I was throwing away. Below is a picture of the front side of the 
PCB. The first thing that I noticed were all those little trimpots. Trimpots are a poor choice to calibrate a multimeter, they are definitely not accurate and don&#39;t maintain their exact 
position if the multimeter is moved, shocked (i.e. dropped) or similar abrupt movements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">See that piece of metal just above the inner two input jacks? That&#39;s the shunt resistor. In principle there&#39;s nothing wrong with bare shunt resistors, 
except that if you take a closer look, you&#39;ll see that it seems broken and soldered together. No, that&#39;s not a sign of quality. The input jacks themselves also don&#39;t look very sturdy; 
just some pieces of metal that insert themselves onto some plastic on the top side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><img alt="cheap chinese multimeter, PCB front" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5020141002_d629b7034a_z.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px; " /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">There&#39;s no input protection to see on the top side, so one would think it&#39;s on the back side of the PCB, right? Right...?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Well, no. On the back side of the PCB there&#39;s nothing except a cheap buzzer (top left), some very bad solder joints on the through-hole components on the 
other side, a dodgy wire going from the top to the bottom, some burn marks which clearly show that the board was hand-soldered (and assembled) and glass fuses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Glass fuses in a multimeter? Really? Glass fuses are only rated to interrupt a current of about 3 - 10 times their rated current value, so in this case somewhere 
between 30A and 100A. Sounds good? It&#39;s not. You can easily exceed that if you work on mains, circuit breakers, etc, yet the meter is supposedly rated CAT II according to IEC 61010 as 
we&#39;ve seen on the first photo. CAT II means that it&#39;s safe to work on a circuit directly connected to the mains. Usually multimeters use HRC fuses (high rupture capacity) which are rated 
to interrupt a current in excess of 6kA (6000A), and for good reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">On top of that comes the fact that there is no input protection whatsoever. Any decent multimeter will have a range of input protection, but first and foremost 
Metal Oxide Varistors, commonly called MOVs. MOVs are there to absorb part of a voltage surge/transient by directing it away from the circuit it protects, since MOVs have a very low resistance at 
very high voltages and an extremely high resistance at normal voltages. If a critical threshold is reached, they melt and/or vaporize, but in doing so they protect the rest of the circuit and 
especially the user of the device. Yet there&#39;s not a single MOV in this multimeter. This one will simply blow up in your hands instead of just dying, there&#39;s not a chance on earth that 
this multimeter is actually in accordance with IEC 61010 CAT II.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><img alt="cheap chinese multimeter, back PCB" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5019530919_7122a28d27_z.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px; " /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">I&#39;ve mainly mentioned safety reasons not to use this kind of multimeter as it can be really dangerous to the user. If you still don&#39;t believe me, take a 
look at the video below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><object height="385" width="640"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M-FZP1U2dkM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" 
/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M-FZP1U2dkM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" 
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">You might argue that you don&#39;t really care about the safety of the meter if you only work on low voltage electronics. While I disagree with that statement, 
last but not least because even low currents and voltages can be deadly, I can understand that attitude. But there are more reasons why you&#39;d want to spend more money on a decent multimeter. 
You want a multimeter that you can trust. One that gives you the same reading time and time again, so there is a way of comparing measurements. Well, it definitely isn&#39;t the case with these 
cheap ones. You want a multimeter with a decent accuracy. Don&#39;t be fooled by the supposed specifications mentioned on the websites of these products, they are no way near reality. The 
accuracy on these cheapos tends to be quite bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">To sum it up, there are plenty of reasons not to buy one of these very cheap multimeters, first and foremost your safety. If you don&#39;t want to spend the money 
on a better one, then just don&#39;t buy any multimeter at all. If you want a good multimeter, you don&#39;t need to go all the way up to Fluke, probably the most expensive multimeters. There are 
plenty of other good brands that give you a high degree of safety, accuracy and features at a lower price: BK Precision, Extech, Agilent, ... Personally I have an Agilent U1242A with which 
I&#39;m very happy:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><img alt="Agilent U1242A multimeter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5020139482_96f5e6f625_z.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px; " /></p>
