==== LinkedIn profile plugin ====
Requirements:
 - ruby
 - rubygems
 - The following gems: oauth, json

Notes:
To use the LinkedIn profile plugin, you need to get a LinkedIn API key at
http://developer.linkedin.com/ first. Once you have a consumer key and secret,
change the entries in the linkedin-config.json file and run linkedin-setup.rb, a
script that will acquire an oauth token and secret and save it into the config
file as well. It is *VERY IMPORTANT* that you keep your oauth_token and secret
*PRIVATE* and never share them with anyone.
